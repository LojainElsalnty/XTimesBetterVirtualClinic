# XTimesBetter-Clinic

## Motivation
In the dynamic landscape of healthcare, the El7a2ny Virtual Clinic emerges as a pioneering solution, dedicated to transforming the interactions between clinics, doctors, and patients. This project is a software solution tailored for clinics and medical practitioners, facilitating a streamlined and automated approach to healthcare processes.

## Build Status
This project does not currently use a continuous integration service. If you encounter any issues during setup, please refer to the installation instructions and feel free to reach out for assistance.

## Code Style
Currently, our project doesn't have a formalized code style guide in place. While we strive for code readability and maintainability, we understand that consistency is crucial for collaborative development.
In the absence of a formal guide, we encourage contributors to follow general best practices for code readability and to maintain consistency within the codebase.

## Code Examples
Below are some code snippets to illustrate specific functionalities of the XTimesBetter Clinic project:
### Example 1 : Google Authentication for Video Calls

```javascript
const { google } = require('googleapis');
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');
const dotenv = require('dotenv').config();
const { v4: uuidv4 } = require('uuid');

const doctorModel = require('../../models/Doctor');
const patientModel = require('../../models/Patient');
const familyModel = require('../../models/Family');

//Create an OAuth2 client with the loaded credentials
const oauth2Client = new google.auth.OAuth2(
    process.env.CLIENT_ID,
    process.env.CLIENT_SECRET,
    process.env.REDIRECT_URL
);

const scopes = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events','https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar'];

// Function to generate a Google Meet link
const AuthenticateGoogle = async (req, res) => {
    const username = req.query.username;
    const type = req.query.type;

    const dataToPass = {
        username: username, 
        type: type,
    };

    const address = oauth2Client.generateAuthUrl({
        access_type: "offline",
        scope: scopes,
        state: Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(dataToPass)).toString('base64'),
    });

    console.log(address);
    res.status(201).json(address);
}
```

### Example 2 : Password Change Code

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const asyncHandler = require('express-async-handler');
const doctorModel = require('../../models/Doctor.js');

const updateDoctorPassword = asyncHandler(async (req, res) => {
    const username = req.query.username;
    const currentPassword = req.query.currentPassword;
    const newPassword = req.query.newPassword;

    if (username === undefined) {
        return res.status(400).json({ message: 'Please enter a username', changePassword: false });
    }

    if (currentPassword === undefined) {
        return res.status(400).json({ message: 'Please enter the current password', changePassword: false});
    }

    if (newPassword === undefined) {
        return res.status(400).json({ message: 'Please enter the new password', changePassword: false});
    }

    const doctorResults = await doctorModel.find({username: username});
    let doctor = null;

    // check that the doctor exists in the database
    if (!doctorResults) {
        return res.status(404).json({ message: 'Doctor is not found', changePassword: false});
    }
    else {
        doctor = doctorResults[0];
    }

    // hash the current password entered by the doctor
    const passwordCorrect = await bcrypt.compare(currentPassword, doctor.password);

    // hashed current password entered does not match the password stored in the database
    if (!passwordCorrect) {
        return res.status(400).json({message: 'Current password is incorrect', changePassword: false});
    }
    else {
        const hashedNewPassword = await bcrypt.hash(newPassword, 10); // hash the new password
        if (newPassword === currentPassword) {
            return res.status(400).json({message: 'Current password can not be same as the new password', changedPassword: false});
        }
        else {
            await doctorModel.findOneAndUpdate({username: username}, {password: hashedNewPassword}); // update the doctor's password
            return res.status(200).json({message: 'Password is changed successfully', changePassword: true});

  delete updatedData.oldname

  // Function to safely trim a string or return undefined if it's not a string
  const trimString = (str) => (typeof str === 'string' ? str.trim() : undefined);

  // Check and update each attribute
  updatedData.name = trimString(updatedData.name);
  //console.log(updatedData);
 
  if (
    updatedData.name !== undefined &&

  }

  if ( updatedData.family_discount ===''  &&  typeof updatedData.family_discount !== 'number' ){
    delete updatedData ['family_discount'];
  }


  try {
    // Find the package by ID and update its attributes
    const package = await packageModel.findOne({ name: oldname , valid : "valid"}); 
    const checkDup = await packageModel.findOne({ name: updatedData.name , valid : "valid"}); 

    if (!checkDup){

  if (package){
    const packageId = package._id;
    const updatedPackage = await packageModel.findByIdAndUpdate(packageId, updatedData, { new: true });



    // if (!updatedPackage) {
    //   return res.status(404).json({ message: 'Package not found' });
    // }

    res.status(200).json({ message: 'Package updated', package: updatedPackage });
  }
  else{
    return res.status(404).json({ message: 'Package not found' });
   }
   }
   else {
    return res.status(406).json({ message: 'Package Name Already Exist' });
   }
  }
  
 
   catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to update package', details: error.message });
  }

}


const deletePackage = async (req, res) => {

try{

    const name= req.body;
    const foundPackage = await packageModel.findOne({ name: name.name , valid : "valid"}) ;
    
    if (!foundPackage) {
      console.log('Package not found');
      res.status(404).json({ message: 'Package not found'});

    } 
    else {
       packageId = foundPackage._id;

    }
}

catch(error){
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to delete package', details: error.message });
}
}



const viewPackage = async (req, res) => {
    const package = await packageModel.find({valid : "valid"});
    console.log("hiiii")
    res.status(200).json(package)
 }


module.exports = {addPackage,updatePackage,deletePackage,viewPackage};

```
### Example 4:Doctor's info 
```javascript 
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const asyncHandler = require('express-async-handler');
